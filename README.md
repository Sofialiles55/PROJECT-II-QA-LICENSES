# Software and code licenses
## What is IP?
intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create.  

There are different types of IP used for different things, For example here:  

-Patents, granted for an invention.  
-Copyright, which is rights over creative work.  
-Trademark, a sign to distinguish the enterprise.    
-Registered design, which protects the way something looks.    
![](https://slideplayer.com/slide/13601645/83/images/2/What+is+IP+Patents+for+the+way+it+works.jpg)    
    
    
  
**There are two "families" of IP:**
  
* Registered IP:  
This type of IP requires an application to an IP office, there are different types of registered IP:  
-Patents, protect inventions.  
-Trade Marks, protect brands, names, logos.  
-Designs, look of product.  
-Geographical Indication, sign of where product is from.  
-Plant Variety Protection, protects new plants. 

* Non-Registered IP:    
In most countries IP does not require registration, Copyright stops people using your work without permission or claiming it as their own.
Copyright laws safeguard writing and literary works, art, photography, films, TV, music, web content, and sound recordings. For small businesses, copyright applies to web pages you create, or original photography, for example.

**Intellectual property in games**:

As game companies are constantly seeking to innovate to stand out from an increasingly crowded market, developing a well-defined and proactive IP strategy to secure appropriate IP rights is essential to their success.

The main types of IP used in games are copyright and Trademark:  

* Copyright guards the creative expression that goes into a video game and is an automatic right that can apply to original literary, musical and artistic works. This could include the code, soundtrack, characters or story line from a game, and the protection it provides helps prevent the duplication of such elements.

* Trade mark registrations can be used to protect the names and logos of gaming companies and products.

## Software and assets licenses

  
First, what is a software license? A software license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software

Software licenses typically provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights.

Software licenses typically are proprietary, free or open source. The distinguishing feature is the terms under which users may redistribute or copy the software for future development or use.

How do they work?  
A software license is a document that states the rights of the developer and user of a piece of software. It defines how the software can be used and how it will be paid for. 

The following are some examples of specifications a license might include:
* how many times the software can be downloaded;
* what the software will cost
* what level of access users will have to the source code.

There are different types of software licenses:

)

Now, an asset license or General Asset License (GAL) was created with the intention of promoting freedom and providing an open framework for the distribution of digital assets. 

The GAL gives everyone the freedom to use assets unconditionally in their work, while guaranteeing that the assets themselves and any improvements made to them will always be available with the same freedom.

Assets are understood to be snippets of work that would generally be combined to form a final work. Examples of this would be 3D models, rigs, materials, textures, sound snippets, etc.

The GAL contains a "Use" clause that is clearly distinguished from the "Distribution" clause, allowing different conditions to be specified for use and for redistribution, a very important distinction when it comes to digital assets. It intends to guarantee the continued openness of digital assets, while simultaneously giving complete freedom to anyone using such assets within their work, to distribute and license their work in whatever way they see fit. The GAL is intended for anyone distributing digital assets meant for use in larger works. The GAL was written specifically with the licensing needs of 3D assets in mind, but can more generally be applied to other digital assets, such as textures, sound snippets, etc.

## Best free licensing options

Use a permissive software license, this is s a free-software license which carries only minimal restrictions on how the software can be used, modified, and redistributed, usually including a warranty disclaimer. Examples include:

-GNU All-permissive License
-MIT License 
-BSD licenses 
-Apache license

**As of 2016, the most popular free-software license is the permissive MIT license, the one we use for our projects!

_**Following is a list of the most popular open source licenses used by developers and their legal risks classification**_

**As you can see the lowest legally risky
 licenses are MIT , Apache and BSD  
  
**MIT LICENSE**    
The MIT License is a permissive free software license. As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.

**Apache license**  
The Apache License is an open source software license released by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).The Apache License allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute any Apache licensed product.

**BSD license**  
BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software.

# QA Workflow

## What is Q/A?
Quality assurance (QA) is any systematic process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements. QA establishes and maintains set requirements for developing or manufacturing reliable products.

In general, these detail-oriented professionals are responsible for the development and implementation of inspection activities, the detection and resolution of problems, and the delivery of satisfactory outcomes.

## Principles of Quality Assurance  

There are two principles to quality assurance. One is “fit for purpose,” meaning the product or service meets its intended purpose. The other is “right first time,” in which any mistakes are immediately dealt with.

The goal is to make the product or service work correctly all the time through the management of the variables in the project.

Sometimes, QC is confused with the QA. Quality control is to examine the product or service and check for the result. Quality Assurance is to examine the processes and make changes to the processes which led to the end-product.

## QA in games

Quality Assurance for games is about finding inconsistencies, glitches, or bugs in the software or game experience. QA involves documenting, reproducing, and reviewing these inconsistencies until they are deemed ok to ship.

QA uses workflow diagrams to define the phases in the development of a project. For example:

## QA phases

1. Analyze Requirements
It costs more to fix a bug that has been detected during testing, as compared to just preventing them at the stage of requirements design. QA professionals should be involved in the analysis and definition of software requirements, both functional and non-functional. QAs must be offered requirements that are consistent, comprehensive, traceable, and clearly marked. This helps the QA team design tests specifically tailored to the software being tested.

2. Plan the tests
The test plan should comprise the software testing strategy, the scope of testing, the project budget, and establish deadlines. 

3. Design the tests
At this stage, QA teams have to craft test cases and checklists that encompass the software requirements.This is also the stage for preparing the staging environment for execution. 

4. Execute Tests and Report Defects
Tests start at the unit level with developers performing unit tests. Then, the QA team runs tests at API and UI levels. All bugs detected are submitted in a defect tracking system. 

5. Run Re-Tests and Regression Tests
Once bugs have been found, submitted, and fixed, QAs test the functions again to ensure that they didn’t miss any anomalies. They also run regression tests to verify that the fixes have not affected the existing functions.

6. Run Release Tests
Once developers issue a release notification that details a list of already implemented features, fixed bugs, recurring issues, and limitations, the QA team must identify the functionalities being affected by these changes. Then, the team must design modified test suites that cover the scope of the new build.

## Quality testing
_**Quality assurance testing is a process that ensures an organization delivers the best products or services possible. **_

Testing refers to the actual testing of a product to meet QC standards. This may involve using or stress testing the product The process identifies problems in the product or service before it goes live.

Testing ensures the identification of errors, bugs, and defects in the software. 

The difference between quality assurance and testing is that quality assurance is about the activities designed to make sure the project is conforming to the expectations of the stakeholders, while test is a process to explore a system to find defects. 

**How quality testing procedure works:**
A typical bug report progression of testing process is seen below:
* Identification. Incorrect program behavior is analyzed and identified as a bug.

* Reporting. The bug is reported. 

* Analysis. The developer responsible for the bug, such as an artist, programmer or game designer checks the malfunction. This is outside the scope of game tester duties, although inconsistencies in the report may require more information or evidence from the tester.

* Verification. After the developer fixes the issue, the tester verifies that the bug no longer occurs. 

Lastly is the stabilization phase, this phase is the last part of development. It is the stage when the game gets approved for deployment.

 The stabilizing phase conducts testing on a solution whose features are complete.

 The team focuses on resolving and triangulating (prioritizing) bugs, environment defining and preparing the solution for release.
